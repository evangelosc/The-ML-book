# The-ML-book
The repository consists of my ML implementations from different books that I have followed.

There are currently two main folders - one for each book.
* [Andriy Burkov](https://github.com/evangelosc/Cpp-Adventures/tree/master/CppTutorials): The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book
* [Aurelien Geron](https://github.com/evangelosc/The-ML-book/tree/master/Aurelien-Geron): Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & Tensorflow (2nd edition - tf2)
